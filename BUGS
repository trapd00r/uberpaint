    text output should be filtered through a logging mechanism
    	- same mechanism could be used for the status line in the manager too

    some keyboard shortcuts for paint are nonfunctional
	- shift+[key] - perhaps they're being filtered?

    toolbar buttons don't react to broadcast messages
	- press 'd', the draw button does not get selected.
	- press '+'/'-', and the brush size DOES change
	- messages might make it there, but they're not responding/pressing
	- There is no association between an imagebutton and a message
	- need to make a "fake button presser"
	- need to add: visually look like a button press, without pressing
	- i wish i made buttons with unique ids now.  that would simplify this.

    paintcan cursor doesn't work
	- i don't know why
	- is this only an OS X related issue?
	- perhaps it's a limitation of libSDL
	- perhaps I'm doing something wrong? Other cursors work
	- this seems wierd.

(6)
    lack of menus
 
(5)
    line draw optimizations are counteracting order for vector line drawing
	- re-implement all of the graphics primitives ?
	- perhaps just re-implement for placing brushes

(4)
    a brush color picked up in one screen may be a different color in the other
    screen, but will draw correctly.
	- a single 'screen palette' needs to be imposed.
	- is this acceptable? 
	- implement brush color remapping?

(3)
    Some resolutions don't draw properly on OS X
	- is this an OS X only issue?
	- mainly, fullscreen modes do not function properly

(2)
    8 bit display does not function
	- drop 8 bit support completely?  This seems acceptable.

(1)
    - the paint callback is getting called with 0,0 when it no longer has focus.
	- it should get called with -1, -1, to tell it that the mouse
	  is external to the screen.
	- this is causing the full-screen redraws when a window is
	  dragged i think.
