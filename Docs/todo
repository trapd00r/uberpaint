JSUI notes:
	try all of the windows.  if none catch focus, then pass it down to 
	the screen, with the mouse adjusted for zoom/position.
	

JSUI (shwee)
    - menus
    - dialogs
    - windows
    - views
    - based on allegro's gui code
    - pull page,pen,gfx_base,gfx_prim out to shwee.
    - scaling of views (perhaps in the 'view' widget)
    - mouse event valve
    - will need to add a "lost focus" and "gained focus" to existing tool code
    - set/get palette function


Next tasks:
	User Interface code
	Color range code
	    - range select, cycle, etc.
	IFF File Saver
	Color tools (Use brush palette, Remap, palette editor)
	brush load and save
	grid 
	    - snap to grid
	    - tile mirror to grid
	    - constrain inside grid
	[ctrl] to draw to main buffer instead of rubberband

	Multiple palettes per image.

	Genericize file io routines
	    jpg load/save/color reduction
	    png load/save
	    arcade load/save ***YES***

Color Remap:
    take the rgb values of the color to be remapped.
	find the distance in 3-space between it and each of the other
	colors.  The closest becomes the new color.
	(perhaps weight it based on hue?)
	(slider:  Accuracy:  Hue |-----[]--------| Intensity )

TODO: 

- look into using the Image Magick libraries for file io and effects

(grouped by functionality, roughly prioritized)

  ui:
    -> shwee/allegro gui clone
	- usefulness is better for me than accuracy to allegro

  tools:
    -> pen
    -> palette selector
    -> palette editor
    -> palette remap
    -> brush palette remap
    -> text input 
	- JAM1  fg=color  bg=transparent
	- JAM2  fg=color  bg=bgcolor
    -> curvy tool
    -> ellipse tool
    -> skew
    -> arbitrary rotate

  utility/file:
    -> save pbm
    -> save as
    -> toolbar / buttons
    -> load / save brush
    -> load / save palette
    -> IFF brush and image loading and saving
    -> arcade graphics, PNG, JPG, GIF import and export

Font:  
    internal font "zarnox"
    load bitmap fonts
    load amiga fonts
    load pc dpaint II/IIe fonts.  (amiga fonts?)

Plugins:
    file load and export filters
    image manipulations filters
